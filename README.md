# disco
Generate feasible Laue Bragg spots from randomly oriented crystals


### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/disco
cd disco
python setup.py install
disco.wow
```


### Usage
Right now all this does is install an admittedly silly commandline application. 
`disco.wow` will plot 100 randomly generated laue patterns and then quit.
